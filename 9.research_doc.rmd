Salas, C., Stage, A. R., & Robinson, A. P. (n.d.). Modeling Effects of Overstory Density and Competing Vegetation on Tree Height Growth.

Developed and evaluated an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] in the Inland Northwest United States. The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth.


Stage, A. R., & Salas, C. (2007). Composition and Productivity. Forest Science, 53(4), 486-492.

A linear model for the interacting effects of elevation, aspect, and slope for use in predicting forest productivity or species composition. The model formulation  integrates interactions of these three factors in a mathematical expression representing their combined effect in terms of a cosine function of aspect with a phase shift and amplitude that change with slope and elevation. This model allows the data to determine how the aspect effect changes with elevation and slope.

A height increment model is developed and evaluated for individual trees of ponderosa pine throughout the species range in western United States... Regression analysis is the most commonly used statistical method in forest modeling. However, research studies with repeated measurements are common in forestry and other biological disciplines. Employs mixed models instead of the regression analysis approach because it allows for proper treatment of error terms in a repeated measures analysis.

##Overstory Trees (BA/HA,Sapwood, Crowns)->Understory Non-Tree Vegetation##

Gregg M. Riegel, R. F. M. and W. C. K. (1992). Competition for Resources Between Understory Vegetation and Overstory Pinus Ponderosa in Northeastern Oregon. Ecological Applications, 2(1), 71-85

"Thinning significantly increased photosynthetically active radiation, decreased midday relative humidity, and increased midday air temperatures. Xylem potential of the dominant graminoid (Carex geyeri), soil water potential, mineralizable nitrogen, and pH were increased within the root-reduction vs. the root-control treatments. Micro- and macronutrients in C. geyeri and Symphoricarpos albus, the dominant shrub, were influenced in both treatments. In- creasing light did not increase understory biomass production. Reducing root competition for soil water and nutrients increased understory aboveground biomass by 53 and 94% in 1986 and 1987, respectively. This research demonstrated that belowground resources were the primary controlling factors of understory production in P. ponderosa forests in north- eastern Oregon"


##Overstory Trees ->Small Tree Growth (Height, BA)##

Keyes CR, Maguire DA. 2007. Seed rain of ponderosa pine beneath partial overstories. New Forests 34(2): 107-114 

"Within each site, the stand of higher density produced more viable seed. Per-tree cone yields were also greater at the site of lesser productivity...Seedfall was not perceived to be a limiting factor on natural regeneration at any of the four partial-overstory stands in this study.


McConnel, B. R., & Smith, J. G. (1971). Response of understory vegetation to ponderosa pine thinning in eastern Washington. Journal of Range Management, 23(3), 203-212.

"Pine thinning caused highly significant increases in understory vegetation. After eight growing seasons, total understory yield increments ranged from 75 lb/acre on the unthinned plots to 417 lb under 26-foot pine spacing...When pine canopy exceeded about 45%, forbs produced more than grasses; below 45% grasses were superios producers. Shrubs were least productive at all levels."



##Site Productivity (Site Index, Asp.Elev., Climate, AET)-> Overstory Trees##

McLeod, S. D. and Running, S. W.: Comparing site quality indices
and productivity in ponderosa pine stands of western Montana,
Can. J. For. Res., 18, 346-352, 1988.

"The following correlations of mean annual stem volume increment were found: with leaf area index, R2=0.93; with available water index, R2=0.95; with site index, R2=0.98; with gross photosynthesis R2=0.96. The available water and photosynthesis indices were also highly correlated to site index (R2>0.95). However, the tree-dependent site quality indices varied by stand density. Leaf area index and volume growth increased with stand density while site index decreased...We conclude that an ecosystem process model can provide an index to site quality independent of tree or stand measurements."

productivity following removal of understory vegetation. Soil. Sci. Soc. Am. J.
60, 1614-1621.

"Tree growth was reduced by competing understory vegetation during the first 12 to 20 yr only; understory vegetation did not reduce the adjusted PAIs during the last 15 yr...The results suggest that understory, vegetation plays an important role in maintaining soil quality."

Testing a juvenile tree growth model sensitive to competition from weeds, using Pinus radiata at two contrasting sites in New Zealand. Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 34(10), 1985-1992. http://doi.org/10.1139/x04-072

"A juvenile tree growth model sensitive to competition from weeds was developed and tested. Tree growth is predicted by reducing potential growth from an empirically determined optimum rate for the site (weed-free) using a seasonally estimated competition modifier, which accounts for the degree of weed competition for both water and light availability"
