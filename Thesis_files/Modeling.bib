abstract = {A juvenile tree growth model sensitSive to competition from weeds was developed and tested. Tree growth is predicted by reducing potential growth from an empirically determined optimum rate for the site (weed-free) using a seasonally estimated competition modifier, which accounts for the degree of weed competition for both water and light availability. The model was tested against data from a field trial at a dryland site, where juvenile Pinus radiata D. Don trees were grown with and without competition from the woody weed broom (Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link). For trees in plots without broom, seasonal fluctuations in growth were adequately modelled by a single-term Fourier series, which showed that maximum rates of diameter growth occurred during early summer. Diameter growth of trees in plots with broom was initially predicted by including a light-competition modifier into the model developed for weed-free plots on sites not subject to growth-limiting seasonal water deficit. Although the light modifier reduced growth from the weed-free state by 12{\%} over the first year and 25{\%} over the second year, modelled values still significantly exceeded measured diameter growth. To account for this overprediction a competition modifier based on modelled root-zone water storage was added into the model. Predictions of diameter growth using this modified model corresponded closely to measured diameter growth in both treatments.},

The multiple curvilinear regression gives the best prediction of species number, with island area making the only significant contribution. The proportion of species endemic to the Gal{\'{a}}pagos is highest in the arid, transition zone and on small islands, and lowest in the littoral and mesic zones. This is explained in terms of zone-specific immigration and extinction rates and the very recent appearance of moist upland climates in the archipelago.},

abstract = {We developed and evaluated an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] in the Inland Northwest United States. The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth. Our model requires attained height rather than tree age as a predictor variable, thereby avoiding the problems of site index. Site effects are introduced as a function of ecological habitat type, elevation, aspect, and slope. We used six data sets totaling 3,785 trees in 314 plots. The structure of the data and the model indicated the need for a mixed-effects, nonlinear modeling approach using maximum likelihood in a linear differential equation with a power transformation. Behavior of the model was analyzed using a state-space approach. Our results show that both overstory and understory density affect height growth, allowing a manager to make informed decisions about vegetation control. FOR. SCI. 54(1):107–122. W E PRESENT AND EVALUATE an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir (Pseudo-tsuga menziesii) in the Inland Northwest. We developed this model using a collection of modeling strat-egies that answer or circumvent a number of challenges that have traditionally beset individual-tree height growth model construction. A major use of models of stand dynamics is to estimate and predict the effects on stand growth of stand density, which is the major factor that the forest manager can ma-nipulate in the developing stand. The development of mod-els that represent forest dynamics has been hampered by the modest detail of data available for modeling height increment. Competition effects have rarely been considered in mod-eling top height growth, because top height growth is as-sumed to be relatively independent of stand density across the range of operational densities (Clutter et al. 1983, Smith et al. 1997, Husch et al. 2003). However, this assumption is not necessarily defensible in natural stands or when trees are competing strongly. Competition during the early years, which is a normal condition in natural and selection forests, reduces height increment and postpones the age of maxi-mum growth-rate by up to 50 –100 years in Europe (Ass-mann 1970). During the juvenile period, reducing the den-sity of competing vegetation plays a critical role in early forest growth (Daniel et al. 1979, Smith et al. 1997). Fur-thermore, several authors have reported stand density ef-fects on height growth of older trees (Gaiser and Merz 1951, Lloyd and Jones 1983, MacFarlane et al. 2000). Also, some authors have reported positive (i.e., increasing) effects of density on both height and diameter growth of juvenile trees (e.g., Scott et al. 1998, Woodruff et al. 2002, Kerr 2003). Some models do include density effects on height growth. For example, adjustments of site index curves due to density have been implemented in some areas of forest height growth modeling (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Flewelling et al. 2001). The influence of stand density on height growth models was recognized in other modeling efforts, but site index was still used as the driving variable (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Cieszewski and Bella 1993, Flewelling et al. 2001, Hall and Bailey 2001, Uzoh and Oliver 2006). A notable exception is the Progno-sis model (Stage 1973, Wykoff et al. 1982), which includes reduction of the height growth through a relation of height to diameter growth without using site index. Most models that include the effects of understory den-sity on height increment are focused on juvenile trees. The greatest potential for improving growth rates in forests is during the early stages of establishment before canopy closure (Mason et al. 1996, Mason 2001, Watt et al. 2004). Accurate modeling of the development of recruited and juvenile trees is crucial for simulation models to achieve a consistent simulation output (Golser and Hasenauer 1997), and development of accurate juvenile tree growth models sensitive to competition would enable managers to make},

abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

abstract = {A height increment model is developed and evaluated for individual trees of ponderosa pine throughout the species range in western United States. The data set used in this study came from long-term permanent research plots in even-aged, pure stands both planted and of natural origin. The data base consists of six levels-of-growing stock studies supplemented by initial spacing and other permanent-plot thinning studies for a total of 310 plots, 34,263 trees and 122,082 observations. Regression analysis is the most commonly used statistical method in forest modeling. However, research studies with repeated measurements are common in forestry and other biological disciplines. We choose the mixed models instead of the regression analysis approach because it allows for proper treatment of error terms in a repeated measures analysis. The model is well behaved and possessed desirable statistical properties. Our goal is to present a single height increment model applicable throughout the geographic range of ponderosa pine in the United States and by using only data from long-term permanent plots on sites capable of the productivity estimated by Meyer.},

abstract = {Quantile regression is a way to estimate the conditional quantiles of a response variable distribution in the linear model that provides a more complete view of possible causal relationships between variables in ecological processes. Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},
