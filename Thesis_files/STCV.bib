abstract = {In a multilevel study to determine limits to underplanted conifer seedling growth, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedlings were planted beneath second-growth Douglas-fir stands that had been thinned to basal areas ranging from 16 to 31 m2/ha. Understory vegetation was treated with a broadcast herbicide application prior to thinning, a directed release herbicide application 2 years later, or no treatment beyond harvest disturbance. Residual overstory density was negatively correlated with percent survival for all four species. Broadcast herbicide application improved survival of grand fir and western hemlock. Western redcedar, grand fir, and western hemlock stem volumes were inversely related to overstory tree density, and this effect increased over time. There was a strong indication that this was also the case for Douglas-fir. Reduction of competing understory vegetation resulted in larger fourth-year stem volumes in grand fir and western hemlock.},

abstract = {The abundance of shrubs, salal and salmonberry in particular, is a characteristic feature of the understory in old-growth, west coast forest stands. We analyzed relationships between forest canopy cover and the cover of the shrub layer, salal, salmonberry, herb layer, and moss layer using data from 157 early-seral (35 year-old) stands from west Vancouver Island having variable canopy cover, canopy species, and site quality. The analysis indicated that (i) canopy cover was influenced by canopy species and site quality, (ii) canopy cover had a strong influence on the cover of shrubs but no influence on the cover of herb and moss layers, and (iii) site quality had a moderately strong influence on the cover of salal and salmonberry and a weak influence on the cover of shrub, herb, and moss layers. As the canopy cover decreased from 95 to 5{\%}, the shrub cover consistently increased from about 5 to 95{\%}. The canopy cover alone was a good predictor of the cover of shrubs (R(2) = 0.83), salal (R(2) = 0.72), and salmonberry (R(2) = 0.73), providing the stands were stratified into poor and rich soil nutrient strata. The quantified relationships between canopy cover and the cover of shrubs, salal, and salmonberry provide a simple tool for foresters to manipulate canopy cover of early-seral stands in perhumid cool mesothermal climates for creating suitable wildlife habitats.},

A split-plot experimental design, with three 5.0- ha blocks, four treatments, and 44 plots, was established in the summer of 1985. Twenty plots (4 x 4 m) were trenched (root-reduction treatment) ;1 m in depth, and 24 non- trenched plots (root-control treatment) were used to assess the effects of root competition of overstory trees on understory plants. Trees were commercially thinned (canopy-reduction treatment) in half of each block (2.5 ha) during the winter and early spring of 1986, from a density of 345 to 148 trees/ha to increase light levels to the understory. Thinning sig- nificantly increased photosynthetically active radiation, decreased midday relative humid- ity, and increased midday air temperatures. Xylem potential of the dominant graminoid (Carex geyeri), soil water potential, mineralizable nitrogen, and pH were increased within the root-reduction vs. the root-control treatments. Micro- and macronutrients in C. geyeri and Symphoricarpos albus, the dominant shrub, were influenced in both treatments. In- creasing light did not increase understory biomass production. Reducing root competition for soil water and nutrients increased understory aboveground biomass by 53 and 94{\%} in 1986 and 1987, respectively. This research demonstrated that belowground resources were the primary controlling factors of understory production in P. ponderosa forests in north- eastern Oregon},

abstract = {Competition from understory vegetation for water and nutrients can limit productivity of young forest stands. Less is known of the effect of understory vegetation on long-term stand growth or soil organic properties. The effect of understory vegetation on periodic annual increments (PAIs) of basal area, height, and volume for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) in central Oregon at 4- or 5-yr intervals was examined for a 35-yr period. Soil C, N, and microbial biomass C (MBC) were also quantified after 32 and 35 yr with and without understory vegetation on a sandy loam pumice soil (Xeric Vitricryand). Five tree spacings, ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 m (154-2469 trees ha(-1)), in combination with two understory treatments (understory vegetation present or continuously absent) were installed in 1959. Total understory vegetation cover averaged 35{\%} between 1959 and 1994 for treatments with understory vegetation present, and was dominated by three shrub species: antelope bitterbrush [Purshia tridentata (Pursh) DC.], greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Green), and snow brush (Ceanothus velutinus Dougl. ex Hook.). Covariance analyses of PAIs for each successive interval were performed using appropriate stand parameters at the start of each interval as covariates. Tree growth was reduced by competing understory vegetation during the first 12 to 20 yr only; understory vegetation did not reduce the adjusted PAIs during the last 15 yr. Soil C and N were measured incrementally to a depth of 24 cm. Presence of understory vegetation resulted in greater C and N in the O horizon and upper 4 to 12 cm of mineral soil. Seasonal MBC, measured at 14-d intervals from May to November, was greater when understory vegetation was present. The results suggest that understory, vegetation plays an important role in maintaining soil quality.},

Don) seedlings were planted in March 2001 within three clearcut-harvested, shelterwood, or thinned stands of mature Douglas-fir near Olympia, Washington. From 2002 to 2005, areas of vegetation control of 0, 4.5, or 9 m(2) were maintained with herbicides around a total 162 seedlings per species. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was 34{\%}, 62{\%}, and 100{\%} of full sunlight in thinned stands, shelterwoods, and clearcuts, respectively. Effects of overstory level and vegetation control on seedling growth and resource availability generally were additive. Seedling stem volume index in clearcuts averaged four to eight times that observed in thinned stands, and with vegetation control, it averaged two to four times that observed without it. In thinned stands, relative growth rate of seedling stem volume index had a positive linear relationship with PAR (R-2 = 0.38). Foliar nitrogen content of Douglas-fir explained 71{\%} of the variation in relative growth rate. Factors explaining the most variation in foliar nitrogen content differed between thinned stands (PAR, R-2 = 0.34) and clearcuts or shelterwoods (midday water potential, R-2 = 0.63), suggesting that light and root competition, respectively, were the primary growth-limiting factors for these overstory levels.},

abstract = {Restoration/fuel reduction treatments are being widely used in fire-prone forests to modify stand structure, reduce risks of severe wildfire, and increase ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances. These treatments are designed to manipulate stand structure and fuels, but may also affect understory vegetation and biodiversity. In this study, we describe prescribed fire and thinning treatment effects on understory vegetation species richness, cover, and species composition in dry coniferous forests of central Washington State, U.S.A. We applied thinning and prescribed fire treatments in factorial design to 12 large (10 ha) management units, and surveyed understory vegetation before treatment and during the second growing season after treatment completion. Many understory vegetation traits changed significantly during the treatment period, regardless of treatment applied, and changes were often proportional to pre-treatment condition. In general, cover declined and species richness increased during the treatment period. Thinning followed by prescribed fire increased species richness, particularly in areas where species richness was low initially. Thinning alone had a similar, but lesser effect. Forb richness was increased by thinning, and shrub richness was increased by the combined thin/burn treatment, but graminoid richness was unaffected. Exotic cover and richness also increased in the combined thin/burn treatment, although they constituted only a very small portion of the total understory. Understory plant cover was not affected by treatments, but did decline from pre- to post-treatment sampling, with cover losses highest in areas where cover was high prior to treatment. Forb cover increased with thinning followed by burning where forb cover was low initially. Burning reduced graminoid cover with or without thinning. Species composition varied within and among treatment units, but was not strongly or consistently affected by treatments. Our study shows that thinning and burning treatments had mostly neutral to beneficial effects on understory vegetation, with only minor increases in exotic species. However, the pre-treatment condition had strong effects on understory dynamics, and also modified some responses to treatments. The maximum benefit of restoration treatments appears to be where understory richness is low prior to treatment, suggesting restoration efforts might be focused on these areas.},

Under limited light (26{\%} +/- 16{\%} of full sun), sapling height and diameter growth were significantly reduced by belowground competition from overstory trees. Regardless of presence or absence of belowground competition from trees, understory vegetation did not have a detectable effect on sapling growth. Nitrogen deficiency in saplings was not detected in the presence of belowground competition: where tree roots were excluded, foliar nitrogen concentration and content increased without an increase in foliar mass. Belowground competition from overstory trees had a greater negative effect on growing season soil water content than did understory vegetation. Under the conditions of restricted light availability in this study, limitations in soil water content from competition had a strong growth-limiting effect on Douglas-fir regeneration. As potential canopy trees in a future uneven-aged stand, this sapling cohort would benefit from root gaps created during harvests.},

abstract = {A juvenile tree growth model sensitSive to competition from weeds was developed and tested. Tree growth is predicted by reducing potential growth from an empirically determined optimum rate for the site (weed-free) using a seasonally estimated competition modifier, which accounts for the degree of weed competition for both water and light availability. The model was tested against data from a field trial at a dryland site, where juvenile Pinus radiata D. Don trees were grown with and without competition from the woody weed broom (Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link). For trees in plots without broom, seasonal fluctuations in growth were adequately modelled by a single-term Fourier series, which showed that maximum rates of diameter growth occurred during early summer. Diameter growth of trees in plots with broom was initially predicted by including a light-competition modifier into the model developed for weed-free plots on sites not subject to growth-limiting seasonal water deficit. Although the light modifier reduced growth from the weed-free state by 12{\%} over the first year and 25{\%} over the second year, modelled values still significantly exceeded measured diameter growth. To account for this overprediction a competition modifier based on modelled root-zone water storage was added into the model. Predictions of diameter growth using this modified model corresponded closely to measured diameter growth in both treatments.},

To assess the effects of root competition of overstory trees on understory species composition, 20 plots (4 x 4 m) were trenched approximately 1.0 m in depth, and compared to 24 nontrenched plots. To increase light levels to understory vegetation, trees were thinned from 345 to 148 trees ha(-1) in half of each block (2.5 ha) during the winter and early spring of 1986. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that light accounted for the greatest environmental resource response among the treatments. The number of species (8) that increased in cover and density was 60{\%} greater when tree root competition was reduced in the root-reduction treatment, versus 5 when tree canopy influences were reduced in the canopy-reduction treatment. Simple correlation showed that changes in species composition were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) related to both changes in aboveground attributes (light, midday air temperature, and soil temperature) and belowground attributes (soil water potential, pH, and nitrogen). Competition for limited resources, light, water, and nutrients, does affect understory species composition as evidenced by the response of individual species to increasing availability of these resources.},

abstract = {We developed and evaluated an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] in the Inland Northwest United States. The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth. Our model requires attained height rather than tree age as a predictor variable, thereby avoiding the problems of site index. Site effects are introduced as a function of ecological habitat type, elevation, aspect, and slope. We used six data sets totaling 3,785 trees in 314 plots. The structure of the data and the model indicated the need for a mixed-effects, nonlinear modeling approach using maximum likelihood in a linear differential equation with a power transformation. Behavior of the model was analyzed using a state-space approach. Our results show that both overstory and understory density affect height growth, allowing a manager to make informed decisions about vegetation control. FOR. SCI. 54(1):107–122. W E PRESENT AND EVALUATE an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir (Pseudo-tsuga menziesii) in the Inland Northwest. We developed this model using a collection of modeling strat-egies that answer or circumvent a number of challenges that have traditionally beset individual-tree height growth model construction. A major use of models of stand dynamics is to estimate and predict the effects on stand growth of stand density, which is the major factor that the forest manager can ma-nipulate in the developing stand. The development of mod-els that represent forest dynamics has been hampered by the modest detail of data available for modeling height increment. Competition effects have rarely been considered in mod-eling top height growth, because top height growth is as-sumed to be relatively independent of stand density across the range of operational densities (Clutter et al. 1983, Smith et al. 1997, Husch et al. 2003). However, this assumption is not necessarily defensible in natural stands or when trees are competing strongly. Competition during the early years, which is a normal condition in natural and selection forests, reduces height increment and postpones the age of maxi-mum growth-rate by up to 50 –100 years in Europe (Ass-mann 1970). During the juvenile period, reducing the den-sity of competing vegetation plays a critical role in early forest growth (Daniel et al. 1979, Smith et al. 1997). Fur-thermore, several authors have reported stand density ef-fects on height growth of older trees (Gaiser and Merz 1951, Lloyd and Jones 1983, MacFarlane et al. 2000). Also, some authors have reported positive (i.e., increasing) effects of density on both height and diameter growth of juvenile trees (e.g., Scott et al. 1998, Woodruff et al. 2002, Kerr 2003). Some models do include density effects on height growth. For example, adjustments of site index curves due to density have been implemented in some areas of forest height growth modeling (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Flewelling et al. 2001). The influence of stand density on height growth models was recognized in other modeling efforts, but site index was still used as the driving variable (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Cieszewski and Bella 1993, Flewelling et al. 2001, Hall and Bailey 2001, Uzoh and Oliver 2006). A notable exception is the Progno-sis model (Stage 1973, Wykoff et al. 1982), which includes reduction of the height growth through a relation of height to diameter growth without using site index. Most models that include the effects of understory den-sity on height increment are focused on juvenile trees. The greatest potential for improving growth rates in forests is during the early stages of establishment before canopy closure (Mason et al. 1996, Mason 2001, Watt et al. 2004). Accurate modeling of the development of recruited and juvenile trees is crucial for simulation models to achieve a consistent simulation output (Golser and Hasenauer 1997), and development of accurate juvenile tree growth models sensitive to competition would enable managers to make},
