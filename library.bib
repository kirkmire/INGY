abstract = {A juvenile tree growth model sensitSive to competition from weeds was developed and tested. Tree growth is predicted by reducing potential growth from an empirically determined optimum rate for the site (weed-free) using a seasonally estimated competition modifier, which accounts for the degree of weed competition for both water and light availability. The model was tested against data from a field trial at a dryland site, where juvenile Pinus radiata D. Don trees were grown with and without competition from the woody weed broom (Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link). For trees in plots without broom, seasonal fluctuations in growth were adequately modelled by a single-term Fourier series, which showed that maximum rates of diameter growth occurred during early summer. Diameter growth of trees in plots with broom was initially predicted by including a light-competition modifier into the model developed for weed-free plots on sites not subject to growth-limiting seasonal water deficit. Although the light modifier reduced growth from the weed-free state by 12{\%} over the first year and 25{\%} over the second year, modelled values still significantly exceeded measured diameter growth. To account for this overprediction a competition modifier based on modelled root-zone water storage was added into the model. Predictions of diameter growth using this modified model corresponded closely to measured diameter growth in both treatments.},

abstract = {Using a factorial combination of understory removal and trenching treatments, we examined the influences of belowground competition from understory and overstory vegetation on growth of naturally established Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) saplings in thinned stands of Douglas-fir on moderately productive, glacially derived soils near Tacoma, Washington. Under limited light (26{\%} +/- 16{\%} of full sun), sapling height and diameter growth were significantly reduced by belowground competition from overstory trees. Regardless of presence or absence of belowground competition from trees, understory vegetation did not have a detectable effect on sapling growth. Nitrogen deficiency in saplings was not detected in the presence of belowground competition: where tree roots were excluded, foliar nitrogen concentration and content increased without an increase in foliar mass. Belowground competition from overstory trees had a greater negative effect on growing season soil water content than did understory vegetation. Under the conditions of restricted light availability in this study, limitations in soil water content from competition had a strong growth-limiting effect on Douglas-fir regeneration. As potential canopy trees in a future uneven-aged stand, this sapling cohort would benefit from root gaps created during harvests.},

abstract = {Fire is thought to be the dominant disturbance agent in pure ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests, but fire severity and disturbances other than fire, and the effects of these events over time, have rarely been analyzed. We first created systematic criteria to (1) identify the causes of tree regeneration and mortality events and (2) classify the severity of these events. These criteria were then applied to understand the effect of events on ponderosa pine forests in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado. For each of nine intensive study plots sampled in the pure ponderosa pine zone of RMNP, we mapped and dated live and dead trees and the spatial extent of fire and non- fire events using dendrochronology. Events were identified using evidence of disturbance agents, such as blue-stain fungus in the case of mountain pine beetles, fire scars, and climatic reconstructions. Disturbance severity was classified based on amounts and spatial distri- bution of regeneration, mortality, and survivors. We studied the temporal and spatial re- lationships between events and tree age structures to determine historical and contemporary stand dynamics. We identified 103 events among the nine study plots; 97{\%} of these events were fire. High-severity events were 7{\%} of events, 2{\%} of events were mixed-severity, and the other 70{\%} were low-severity. The severity of 20{\%} of events could not be determined. All but one of the high-severity events were fire. In seven plots, at least one crown fire occurred within the last 300 years. In RMNP, pre-EuroAmerican settlement crown fires led to dense, even-aged stands. Subsequent surface fires killed some trees and facilitated the regeneration of others, leading to less dense, uneven-aged stands after 200–300 years. Climate may be the cause or co-cause of one or two regeneration pulses within the last 300 years, but most regeneration and mortality is associated with fire. The historical occurrence of crown fires, as well as surface fires, in pure ponderosa pine forests in RMNP indicates that the fire regime is more variable than previously thought. Suppression of crown fires, though not completely possible, would move the fire regime outside its historical range of natural variability.},

@article{Coomes2007,
abstract = {1. Understanding the factors influencing tree growth is central to forest ecology because of the significance of growth to forest structure and biomass. One of the simplest, yet most controversial growth models, proposed by Enquist and colleagues, predicts that stem-diameter growth scales as the one-third power of stem diameter. Recent analyses of large-scale data sets have challenged the generality of this theory and highlighted the influence of resource competition on the scaling of growth with size. 2. Here we explore the factors regulating the diameter growth of 3334 trees of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) growing in natural single-species forests in New Zealand. Maximum-likelihood modelling was used to quantify the influences of tree size, altitude, the basal area of taller neighbours (B-L) and the basal area of all neighbours (B-T) on growth. Our interpretation of the models assumed that taller neighbours compete for light whereas all neighbours compete for nutrients. 3. The regression analyses indicate that competition for light has a strong influence on the growth of small trees, whereas competition for nutrients affects trees of all sizes. These findings are consistent with experimental manipulation studies showing that competition for light and nutrients inhibits the growth of small mountain beech trees, and fertilizer application studies showing that nitrogen limits the growth of large trees. 4. Tree growth declined with altitude. The regression analyses suggest that the intensity of light competition also declines with altitude, when trees with similar B-T and B-L values were compared along the gradient. These results are consistent with observations that trees become stunted and have more open canopies at high altitudes. 5. Our study is the first to build the effects of competition and environment into Enquist's model of tree growth. We show that competitive interactions alter the scaling of mean growth rate with size, whereas altitude does not influence the scaling of potential growth rate with size.},

abstract = {We have developed a density management diagram (DMD) for even-aged mixed-conifer stands in the Sierra Nevada Mountains using forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data. Analysis plots were drawn from FIA plots in California, southern Oregon, and western Nevada which included those conifer species associated with the mixed-conifer forest type. A total of 204 plots met the selection criteria for analysis, which were for even-agedness and species composition. Even-agedness was characterized by a ratio between two calculations of stand density index. Species composition included admixtures of the species characterizing the Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer type with up to 80{\%} of stand basal area contributed by ponderosa and Jeffrey pines. The DMD is unbiased with respect to species composition and therefore should be broadly applicable to the mixed-conifer type. The DMD is intended for use in even-aged stands, but may be used for uneven-aged management where a large-group selection system is used. Examples of density management regimes are illustrated, and guidelines for use are provided.},

abstract = {Quantile regression is a way to estimate the conditional quantiles of a response variable distribution in the linear model that provides a more complete view of possible causal relationships between variables in ecological processes. Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

abstract = {Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) seedlings were planted in March 2001 within three clearcut-harvested, shelterwood, or thinned stands of mature Douglas-fir near Olympia, Washington. From 2002 to 2005, areas of vegetation control of 0, 4.5, or 9 m(2) were maintained with herbicides around a total 162 seedlings per species. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was 34{\%}, 62{\%}, and 100{\%} of full sunlight in thinned stands, shelterwoods, and clearcuts, respectively. Effects of overstory level and vegetation control on seedling growth and resource availability generally were additive. Seedling stem volume index in clearcuts averaged four to eight times that observed in thinned stands, and with vegetation control, it averaged two to four times that observed without it. In thinned stands, relative growth rate of seedling stem volume index had a positive linear relationship with PAR (R-2 = 0.38). Foliar nitrogen content of Douglas-fir explained 71{\%} of the variation in relative growth rate. Factors explaining the most variation in foliar nitrogen content differed between thinned stands (PAR, R-2 = 0.34) and clearcuts or shelterwoods (midday water potential, R-2 = 0.63), suggesting that light and root competition, respectively, were the primary growth-limiting factors for these overstory levels.},

Residual overstory density was negatively correlated with percent survival for all four species. Broadcast herbicide application improved survival of grand fir and western hemlock. Western redcedar, grand fir, and western hemlock stem volumes were inversely related to overstory tree density, and this effect increased over time. There was a strong indication that this was also the case for Douglas-fir. Reduction of competing understory vegetation resulted in larger fourth-year stem volumes in grand fir and western hemlock.},

abstract = {Competition from understory vegetation for water and nutrients can limit productivity of young forest stands. Less is known of the effect of understory vegetation on long-term stand growth or soil organic properties. The effect of understory vegetation on periodic annual increments (PAIs) of basal area, height, and volume for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) in central Oregon at 4- or 5-yr intervals was examined for a 35-yr period. Soil C, N, and microbial biomass C (MBC) were also quantified after 32 and 35 yr with and without understory vegetation on a sandy loam pumice soil (Xeric Vitricryand). Five tree spacings, ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 m (154-2469 trees ha(-1)), in combination with two understory treatments (understory vegetation present or continuously absent) were installed in 1959. Total understory vegetation cover averaged 35{\%} between 1959 and 1994 for treatments with understory vegetation present, and was dominated by three shrub species: antelope bitterbrush [Purshia tridentata (Pursh) DC.], greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula Green), and snow brush (Ceanothus velutinus Dougl. ex Hook.). Covariance analyses of PAIs for each successive interval were performed using appropriate stand parameters at the start of each interval as covariates. Tree growth was reduced by competing understory vegetation during the first 12 to 20 yr only; understory vegetation did not reduce the adjusted PAIs during the last 15 yr. Soil C and N were measured incrementally to a depth of 24 cm. Presence of understory vegetation resulted in greater C and N in the O horizon and upper 4 to 12 cm of mineral soil. Seasonal MBC, measured at 14-d intervals from May to November, was greater when understory vegetation was present. The results suggest that understory, vegetation plays an important role in maintaining soil quality.},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

abstract = {A carbon sequestration strategy has recently been proposed in which a forest is actively managed, and a fraction of the wood is selectively harvested and stored to prevent decomposition. The forest serves as a ‘carbon scrubber' or ‘carbon remover' that provides continuous sequestration (negative emissions). Earlier estimates of the theoretical potential of wood harvest and storage (WHS) based on coarse wood production rates were 10±5 GtC y−1. Starting from this physical limit, here we apply a number of practical constraints: (1) land not available due to agriculture; (2) forest set aside as protected areas, assuming 50{\%}in the tropics and 20{\%}in temperate and boreal forests; (3) forests difficult to access due to steep terrain; (4) wood use for other purposes such as timber and paper. This ‘top-down' approach yields aWHS potential 2.8 GtCy−1.Alternatively, a ‘bottom-up' approach, assumingmore efficientwood use without increasing harvest, finds 0.1–0.5 GtC y−1 available for carbon sequestration. We suggest a range of 1–3GtC y−1 carbon sequestration potential if major effort ismade to expand managed forests and/or to increase harvest intensity. The implementation of such a scheme at our estimated lower value of 1 GtC y−1 would imply a doubling of the current world wood harvest rate. This can be achieved by harvesting wood at a moderate harvesting intensity of 1.2 tC ha−1 y−1, over a forest area of 8 Mkm2 (800 Mha). To achieve the higher value of 3 GtC y−1, forests need to be managed this way on half of the world's forested land, or on a smaller area but with higher harvest intensity.We recommendWHS be considered part of the portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation options that needs further research.},

abstract = {A height increment model is developed and evaluated for individual trees of ponderosa pine throughout the species range in western United States. The data set used in this study came from long-term permanent research plots in even-aged, pure stands both planted and of natural origin. The data base consists of six levels-of-growing stock studies supplemented by initial spacing and other permanent-plot thinning studies for a total of 310 plots, 34,263 trees and 122,082 observations. Regression analysis is the most commonly used statistical method in forest modeling. However, research studies with repeated measurements are common in forestry and other biological disciplines. We choose the mixed models instead of the regression analysis approach because it allows for proper treatment of error terms in a repeated measures analysis. The model is well behaved and possessed desirable statistical properties. Our goal is to present a single height increment model applicable throughout the geographic range of ponderosa pine in the United States and by using only data from long-term permanent plots on sites capable of the productivity estimated by Meyer.},

abstract = {Estimation of reference growth curves for children's height and weight has traditionally relied on normal theory to construct families of quantile curves based on samples from the reference population. Age-specific parametric transformation has been used to significantly broaden the applicability of these normal theory methods. Non-parametric quantile regression methods offer a complementary strategy for estimating conditional quantile functions. We compare estimated reference curves for height using the penalized likelihood approach of Cole and Green (Statistics in Medicine 1992; 11:1305–1319) with quantile regression curves based on data used for modern Finnish reference charts. An advantage of the quantile regression approach is that it is relatively easy to incorporate prior growth and other covariates into the analysis of longitudinal growth data. Quantile specific autoregressive models for unequally spaced measurements are introduced and their application to diagnostic screening is illustrated.

abstract = {Managing second-growth forests to conserve biodiversity has been proposed by both foresters and conservation biologists. Management, however, can have unintended consequences, including reduction in native species diversity and increased invasion by exotic species. Our goal was to determine if inducing heterogeneity in managed forest canopies could promote a diversity of native species without contributing markedly to invasion by exotic species. We examined 1- and 3-year responses of understory plants to variable-density thinning of 55- to 65-year-old stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco. Our study stands had been managed either with retention of old-growth legacies (large live trees, dead trees, and fallen trees) and no thinning or with removal of legacies and twice-repeated conventional thinning. Variable-density thinning initially resulted in decreased understory cover but increased importance of 20 native species, including 2 species of trees. Two native species, however, decreased in importance, and 11 exotic species increased in importance. Within 3 years, understory cover recovered, species richness increased by {\textgreater}150{\%}, only four exotic species persisted with increased importance, eight native species (including four graminoids) increased in importance, and seven native species decreased in importance. Variable-density thinning shows promise as part of holistic silvicultural systems applied across landscapes throughout stand rotations and as a technique to restore vegetative complexity to closed-canopy second-growth forests.},

abstract = {The abundance of shrubs, salal and salmonberry in particular, is a characteristic feature of the understory in old-growth, west coast forest stands. We analyzed relationships between forest canopy cover and the cover of the shrub layer, salal, salmonberry, herb layer, and moss layer using data from 157 early-seral (35 year-old) stands from west Vancouver Island having variable canopy cover, canopy species, and site quality. The analysis indicated that (i) canopy cover was influenced by canopy species and site quality, (ii) canopy cover had a strong influence on the cover of shrubs but no influence on the cover of herb and moss layers, and (iii) site quality had a moderately strong influence on the cover of salal and salmonberry and a weak influence on the cover of shrub, herb, and moss layers. As the canopy cover decreased from 95 to 5{\%}, the shrub cover consistently increased from about 5 to 95{\%}. The canopy cover alone was a good predictor of the cover of shrubs (R(2) = 0.83), salal (R(2) = 0.72), and salmonberry (R(2) = 0.73), providing the stands were stratified into poor and rich soil nutrient strata. The quantified relationships between canopy cover and the cover of shrubs, salal, and salmonberry provide a simple tool for foresters to manipulate canopy cover of early-seral stands in perhumid cool mesothermal climates for creating suitable wildlife habitats.},

We propose a new walkthrough method for reducing boundary overlap bias that diminishes or eliminates the need to work outside the tract and accommodates irregular boundaries easily. Under typical conditions, the walk- through method eliminates the boundary overlap bias associated with most objects near the border and reduces it for the remaining objects. The walkthrough method is object-centered in conception and implementation, but the measurements required are simple. The walk- through method complements existing methods for correcting boundary overlap bias and should prove especially helpful when conditions make existing methods difficult or impos- sible to use.},

abstract = {Restoration/fuel reduction treatments are being widely used in fire-prone forests to modify stand structure, reduce risks of severe wildfire, and increase ecosystem resilience to natural disturbances. These treatments are designed to manipulate stand structure and fuels, but may also affect understory vegetation and biodiversity. In this study, we describe prescribed fire and thinning treatment effects on understory vegetation species richness, cover, and species composition in dry coniferous forests of central Washington State, U.S.A. We applied thinning and prescribed fire treatments in factorial design to 12 large (10 ha) management units, and surveyed understory vegetation before treatment and during the second growing season after treatment completion. Many understory vegetation traits changed significantly during the treatment period, regardless of treatment applied, and changes were often proportional to pre-treatment condition. In general, cover declined and species richness increased during the treatment period. Thinning followed by prescribed fire increased species richness, particularly in areas where species richness was low initially. Thinning alone had a similar, but lesser effect. Forb richness was increased by thinning, and shrub richness was increased by the combined thin/burn treatment, but graminoid richness was unaffected. Exotic cover and richness also increased in the combined thin/burn treatment, although they constituted only a very small portion of the total understory. Understory plant cover was not affected by treatments, but did decline from pre- to post-treatment sampling, with cover losses highest in areas where cover was high prior to treatment. Forb cover increased with thinning followed by burning where forb cover was low initially. Burning reduced graminoid cover with or without thinning. Species composition varied within and among treatment units, but was not strongly or consistently affected by treatments. Our study shows that thinning and burning treatments had mostly neutral to beneficial effects on understory vegetation, with only minor increases in exotic species. However, the pre-treatment condition had strong effects on understory dynamics, and also modified some responses to treatments. The maximum benefit of restoration treatments appears to be where understory richness is low prior to treatment, suggesting restoration efforts might be focused on these areas.},

abstract = {Stand-level spatial pattern influences key aspects of resilience and ecosystem function such as disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer forests. Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet, methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify reference patterns based on a specified inter-tree distance that defines when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters, downscaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer. Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions, sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate adaptation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to test the hypothesis that water and nutrients, and not light, control understory plant species composition in a Pinus ponderosa forest in northeastern Oregon. The experiment was conducted as a split-plot experimental design with a 2 x 2 factorial analysis. To assess the effects of root competition of overstory trees on understory species composition, 20 plots (4 x 4 m) were trenched approximately 1.0 m in depth, and compared to 24 nontrenched plots. To increase light levels to understory vegetation, trees were thinned from 345 to 148 trees ha(-1) in half of each block (2.5 ha) during the winter and early spring of 1986. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that light accounted for the greatest environmental resource response among the treatments. The number of species (8) that increased in cover and density was 60{\%} greater when tree root competition was reduced in the root-reduction treatment, versus 5 when tree canopy influences were reduced in the canopy-reduction treatment. Simple correlation showed that changes in species composition were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) related to both changes in aboveground attributes (light, midday air temperature, and soil temperature) and belowground attributes (soil water potential, pH, and nitrogen). Competition for limited resources, light, water, and nutrients, does affect understory species composition as evidenced by the response of individual species to increasing availability of these resources.},

abstract = {A whole-stand growth model, Scube, was developed for spruce-dominated, even-aged, natural and planted stands, using permanent sample plot data from the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia, Canada. Available data were limited, with no information on mature planted stands or thinning treatments. A parsimonious model design, incorporating knowledge of stand dynamics and experience from other forests, made possible a logical reproduction of observed behavior and plausible extrapolations to other conditions. Scube consists of a system of four differential equations, describing the evolution of four state variables: top height, trees per hectare, basal area, and a stand closure indicator. Concepts of closure and site occupancy drive the behavior of young stands and the response to thinning. Parameters were estimated through numerical optimization of several residual functions, reflecting different projection interval types and weighting strategies. Differences in estimates among the various criteria were small. Calculations are facilitated through expressions that remain invariant in the absence of disturbances. The methods generalize the algebraic difference approach and related forest modeling techniques, linking them to standard dynamical systems theory.},

abstract = {Growth and yield modeling has a long history in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J.W., Hall, O.F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183-188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand table projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed.

Often, the primary goal is to characterize the change in response over time and the factors that influence change. Factors can affect not only the location but also more generally the shape of the distribution of the response over time. To make inference about the shape of a population distribution, the widely popular mixed-effects regression, for example, would be inadequate, if the distribution is not approximately Gaussian. We propose a novel linear model for quantile regression (QR) that includes random effects in order to account for the dependence between serial observations on the same subject.

In a simulation study, the proposed method had an advantage in terms of mean squared error of the QR estimator, when compared with the approach that considers penalized fixed effects. Following our strategy, a nearly optimal degree of shrinkage of the individual effects is automatically selected by the data and their likelihood. Also, our model appears to be a robust alternative to the mean regression with random effects when the location parameter of the conditional distribution of the response is of interest.

abstract = {We developed and evaluated an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] in the Inland Northwest United States. The model predicts growth for all tree sizes continuously, rather than requiring a transition between independent models for juvenile and mature growth phases. The model predicts the effects of overstory and understory vegetative competition on height growth. Our model requires attained height rather than tree age as a predictor variable, thereby avoiding the problems of site index. Site effects are introduced as a function of ecological habitat type, elevation, aspect, and slope. We used six data sets totaling 3,785 trees in 314 plots. The structure of the data and the model indicated the need for a mixed-effects, nonlinear modeling approach using maximum likelihood in a linear differential equation with a power transformation. Behavior of the model was analyzed using a state-space approach. Our results show that both overstory and understory density affect height growth, allowing a manager to make informed decisions about vegetation control. FOR. SCI. 54(1):107–122. W E PRESENT AND EVALUATE an individual-tree height growth model for Douglas-fir (Pseudo-tsuga menziesii) in the Inland Northwest. We developed this model using a collection of modeling strat-egies that answer or circumvent a number of challenges that have traditionally beset individual-tree height growth model construction. A major use of models of stand dynamics is to estimate and predict the effects on stand growth of stand density, which is the major factor that the forest manager can ma-nipulate in the developing stand. The development of mod-els that represent forest dynamics has been hampered by the modest detail of data available for modeling height increment. Competition effects have rarely been considered in mod-eling top height growth, because top height growth is as-sumed to be relatively independent of stand density across the range of operational densities (Clutter et al. 1983, Smith et al. 1997, Husch et al. 2003). However, this assumption is not necessarily defensible in natural stands or when trees are competing strongly. Competition during the early years, which is a normal condition in natural and selection forests, reduces height increment and postpones the age of maxi-mum growth-rate by up to 50 –100 years in Europe (Ass-mann 1970). During the juvenile period, reducing the den-sity of competing vegetation plays a critical role in early forest growth (Daniel et al. 1979, Smith et al. 1997). Fur-thermore, several authors have reported stand density ef-fects on height growth of older trees (Gaiser and Merz 1951, Lloyd and Jones 1983, MacFarlane et al. 2000). Also, some authors have reported positive (i.e., increasing) effects of density on both height and diameter growth of juvenile trees (e.g., Scott et al. 1998, Woodruff et al. 2002, Kerr 2003). Some models do include density effects on height growth. For example, adjustments of site index curves due to density have been implemented in some areas of forest height growth modeling (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Flewelling et al. 2001). The influence of stand density on height growth models was recognized in other modeling efforts, but site index was still used as the driving variable (Alexander 1966, Alexander et al. 1967, Cieszewski and Bella 1993, Flewelling et al. 2001, Hall and Bailey 2001, Uzoh and Oliver 2006). A notable exception is the Progno-sis model (Stage 1973, Wykoff et al. 1982), which includes reduction of the height growth through a relation of height to diameter growth without using site index. Most models that include the effects of understory den-sity on height increment are focused on juvenile trees. The greatest potential for improving growth rates in forests is during the early stages of establishment before canopy closure (Mason et al. 1996, Mason 2001, Watt et al. 2004). Accurate modeling of the development of recruited and juvenile trees is crucial for simulation models to achieve a consistent simulation output (Golser and Hasenauer 1997), and development of accurate juvenile tree growth models sensitive to competition would enable managers to make},

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

A split-plot experimental design, with three 5.0- ha blocks, four treatments, and 44 plots, was established in the summer of 1985. Twenty plots (4 x 4 m) were trenched (root-reduction treatment) ;1 m in depth, and 24 non- trenched plots (root-control treatment) were used to assess the effects of root competition of overstory trees on understory plants. Trees were commercially thinned (canopy-reduction treatment) in half of each block (2.5 ha) during the winter and early spring of 1986, from a density of 345 to 148 trees/ha to increase light levels to the understory. Thinning sig- nificantly increased photosynthetically active radiation, decreased midday relative humid- ity, and increased midday air temperatures. Xylem potential of the dominant graminoid (Carex geyeri), soil water potential, mineralizable nitrogen, and pH were increased within the root-reduction vs. the root-control treatments. Micro- and macronutrients in C. geyeri and Symphoricarpos albus, the dominant shrub, were influenced in both treatments. In- creasing light did not increase understory biomass production. Reducing root competition for soil water and nutrients increased understory aboveground biomass by 53 and 94{\%} in 1986 and 1987, respectively.

The study was established in 1969 in a 20-year-old plantation, thinned to basal areas of 9, 16, 23, 30, and 37 m(2) ha(-1) and rethinned three times. The objective was to determine the effect of stand density regimes on productivity, understory vegetation, aboveground carbon storage, and mortality caused mainly by Dendroctonus infestations. Results showed that without mortality, basal area and volume increments were not affected by thinning the plantation to 16 m(2) ha(-1) from 37 m(2) ha(-1). With Dendroctonus actively attacking trees, the plantation could be thinned to 9 m(2) ha(-1) without sacrificing volume increment, because the level of mortality increased with stand density index. The thinning intensity did not affect the abundance of understory vegetation but did affect the cover of understory trees and graminoids. Intensively managed plantations could sequester and store the same amount of carbon as less intensively managed plantations. However, because fire is a major component in a pine-dominant ecosystem, carbon in larger diameter trees would be more resilient to wildfire than carbon in small diameter trees or understory vegetation.},

abstract = {A tree diameter growth function is an important component of an individual-tree model. This function can be considered as a mixed-effects model, in which a diameter measurement can be used to calibrate (or localize) the equation to produce improved diameter predictions for the same tree in the future. Another approach considered in this study involved a system of quantile regressions, in which future diameters can be determined through interpolation, based on a current diameter measurement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of quantile regression and mixed-effects models in predicting tree diameter growth. Tree diameter at the end of each growth period was predicted from diameter at the beginning of the period by use of one of the four methods: the mixed-effects model and three quantile regression methods that were based on nine quantiles, five quantiles, and three quantiles. The mixed-effects model performed as well as the three quantile regression methods, based on the mean absolute difference and fit index, but was far superior in terms of the mean difference. The mixed-effects model produced an unbiased prediction of future diameter, up to ten years into the future, when calibrated with a current diameter measurement. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An ecosystem process model is described that calculates the carbon, water and nitrogen cycles through a forest ecosystem. The model, FOREST-BGC, treats canopy interception and evaporation, transpiration, photosynthesis, growth and maintenance respiration, carbon allocation above and below-ground, litterfall, decomposition and nitrogen mineralization. The model uses leaf area index (lai) to quantify the forest structure important for energy and mass exchange, and this represents a key simplification for regional scale applications. FOREST-BGC requires daily incoming short-wave radiation, air temperature, dew point, and precipitation as driving variables. The model was used to simulate the annual hydrologic balance and net primary production of a hypothetical forest stand in seven contrasting environments across North America for the year 1984. Hydrologic partitioning ranged from 14/86/0{\%} for evaporation, transpiration and outflow, respectively, in Fairbanks, AK (annual precipitation of 313 mm) to 10/27/66{\%} in Jacksonville, FL (annual ppt of 1244 mm), and these balances changed as lai was increased from 3 to 9 in successive simulations. Net primary production (npp) ranged from 0.0 t C ha−1 year−1 at Tucson, AZ, to 14.1 t C ha−1 year−1 at Knoxville, TN and corresponded reasonably with observed values at each site. The sensitivity of ecosystem processes to varying lai in different climates was substantial, and underscores the utility of parameterizing this model at regional scales in the future with forest lai measurements derived from satellite imagery.},
